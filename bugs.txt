1. Referencing Issue

How do i reference the content of the pTag here?

<p class="dealer-hand-value">Value is: </p>


const dealerValue = document.getElementsByClassName("dealer-hand-value");
console.log(dealerValue[0].textContent)

We are dealing with a class, so we need to remember to reference [0], which is the first item in the class
